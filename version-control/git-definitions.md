# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. Developers use version control to work on projects with one another, being able to work and make changes on a project .

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch gives you a copy of your project to work on, for example a branch can be a part of a project where you would like to add different feature to it so you would create a branch for each specific feature you would like to add then once youâ€™re finished you would merge it into the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A Commit is a save point in Git. The best practices for commit messages would be by having very clear and detailed messages that states what had been changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

For example a merge conflict happens when 2 people are working together on a prjoct and are unable to merge the 2 feature branches to the master branch.
